Tandem is a hackable visual editor for web applications that gives you tools similar to what you'd find in apps such as Sketch, and Photoshop. 

Tandem works with most languages & frameworks. Just open up any `index.html` file or url in Tandem and start writing code in your text editor. Tandem will
pickup changes in realtime & provide a preview of your application that you can manipulate visually. Changes made in Tandem are automatically sent
back to your text editor in the supported languages you're writing in.
