Tandem is a hackable visual editor for web applications that is similar to what you'd find in apps such as [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), and [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html).

Tandem provides a *live preview* of your application that you can manipulate visually. It's intended to work with *all* programming languages, and frameworks, so you should be able to start using it *immediately* with your existing codebase. As part of a litmus test for Tandem, it
was actually used to build itself.

Tandem is code-first, and unoppinionated about how you structure your code. The application synchronizes changes with your text editor in realtime.

Currently,¬†Tandem works well with **ReactJS**, **Sass**, **Less*, **HTML**, **CSS**, and other frameworks and languages.

#### Installation

Tandem is still very buggy, but you can play around with the most recent version here:

Also, be sure to install either the [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tandemcode.tandem-vscode-extension), or [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atom-tandem-extension) extension.

#### Features

# Development

To get started, run `npm install && WATCH=1 npm run build`. After that, go ahead and run `npm run code workspace.tandem` which will open Tandem *in* Tandem:

After you've booted up Tandem in Tandem, open up the `src/**` directory and start hacking away.

#### CLI commands

Other CLI commands that may help with the dev process

```
# builds the source files in out/
npm run build;
