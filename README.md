[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/crcn/tandem.svg?token=36W5GEcyRPyiCuMVDHBJ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/crcn/tandem)

Tandem is a code-first & hackable visual editor for web development.

You can play with the current build [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k9eqwmksv0655ss/AABQyfP5xWf4nbynRm0-OxKJa?dl=0) for Mac OSX. **Please note that the current application is a *preview* of what's to come. Expect bugs, and missing features**. Aso be sure
to install the [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atom-tandem-extension), or [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tandemcode.tandem-vscode-extension) extensions for the best experience.

Tandem displays a *live preview* of your application that you can manipulate visually - this is possible by a custom browser VM that runs your application in the background. It's intended to work with *all* programming languages, and frameworks, so you should be able to start using it *immediately* with your existing codebase. As part of a litmus test, **Tandem was actually used to build itself**.

Tandem is unoppinionated about how you structure your code. Just open any `index.html` file, and Tandem will automatically run your application & display a preview that you can edit. When you make changes in Tandem, the application
will use source maps (assuming you have them turned on) to identify where to write code, and what languages to write code in. If you've installed the text editor extension, Tandem will send code changes back to your text editor that you can
then adjust to fit your coding style.

#### Motivation

TODO

- build a platform that provides tooling for frameworks
- eventually have an editor that allows for most editing in the UI
- completely transparent
- why open source?
- provide
- realization that there are many flavors of web apps. Open source to allow people to build UI tools according to their needs.

<!--I've found that developing UI application feels a bit backwards, and I sought to develop tooling that was a bit more intuitive. There are already countless HTML editors on the web. However, most I've found to-->

#### Features

- Writes code in the languages you're using. Currently supported languages include `Sass`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.
- Can run local files, and urls
- Responsive testing


#### Roadmap

Short list of cool features that are in the pipeline for Tandem. Cast your vote with ¬†üëç or üëé for each of these ideas.

- [Ability to change browser rendering engine: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS, Opera, Internet Explorerer, etc.](https://github.com/tandemcode/tandem/issues/386)
- [Webpack dependency graph strategy](https://github.com/tandemcode/tandem/issues/387)
- Collaboration extension
- Ability to edit SVG graphics

# Development

To get started, run `npm install && WATCH=1 npm run build`. After that, go ahead and run `npm run code workspace.tandem` which will open Tandem *in* Tandem:

After you've booted up Tandem in Tandem, open up the `src/**` directory and start hacking away.

#### CLI commands

Other CLI commands that may help with the dev process

```
# builds the source files in out/
npm run build;

# builds the distributable app in dist/zip/[app].zip
npm run build:dist

# runs the desktop application
npm run code;

# runs tests
npm test;
```

#### Directory structure

- `src/` - source files for main `Tandem` application, and packages
  - `@tandem/` - tandem packages (core modules & extensions)
   - `tandem-client/` - client library communicating with tandem app - used in vscode, and atom extensions.
   - `tandem-code/` - tandem desktop application sources
   - `webpack-tandem-jsx-loader/` - [Webpack](//webpack.js.org) JSX loader for Tandem
