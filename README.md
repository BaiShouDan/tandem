# interface-builder


### Why?

- many times faster than react
- build interfaces without code
- easily integrate *into* code
- allow anyone non-technical to create UIs


#### Features

- each component can take an input & an output. The i/o components would be tied
to the actual editor interface. This would enable components to be more greatly simplified. A
good example of this might be an authentication form which asks for particular fiends & schema.


This sort of thing could even be used to build sophisticated applications such as browsertap. 



#### game plan

1. resolve what the data structure is & how components are connected together
2. figure out how to transpile data structure to JavaScript
