### What can you do with Saffron?

#### Use it as an education tool

- Augments CSS & HTML
- nothing under the hood
- understand quickly how HTML & CSS code affects UI

#### Extend it

- Built initially for HTML & CSS, but not limited to it. It's possibly to add support for other
platforms and rendering engines such as WebGL, and Canvas.


#### Design tool

- should be familiar coming from sketch, and other apps.
- reduce design translation errors - since designs are code.

#### Web application tool
