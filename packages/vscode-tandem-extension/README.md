#### Features

- Syntax highlighting for Paperclip extensions
- "Open Tandem in new window" command

#### Goals

Enough tooling where documentation is somewhat unnecessary for paperclip

TODOS:

- PING dev server until there's a connection
- Do NOT require tandem.config.js. Config should be provided in extension. 
- "Open component in tandem" command
- Source of truth needs to be vscode
- "Edit visually" button when viewing paperclip files
  - Should Tandem electron app
