RESEARCH:

- [ ] spread prop for react. Why? Why not?

IMMEDIATE:

(need to start using tandem to build itself completely)

- [ ] Mutations lib
- [ ] Tandem
  - [ ] Components Pane
    - [ ] Delete components
    - [ ] DND components to existing components
  - [ ] CSS Inspector
    - [ ] toggle eye
    - [ ] add declaration
    - [ ] delete declaration
    - [ ] edit declaration
    - [ ] add style rule (auto add to scoped style element)
    - [ ] `:root` inspecting
- [ ] VSCode extension wire up

HIGH PRIO:

- [ ] paperclipc
  - [ ] edit lib (need mutations module)
  - [ ] Must work with firefox

- [ ] Native elements pane

- [ ] Components pane
  - [ ] + button
  - [ ] DND elements to stage (create new window)
    - [ ] insert preview for elements that do not have one
  - [ ] DND elements to other elements
  - [ ] native elements

- [ ] Paperclip
  - [ ] 

PROBLEMS:

- [ ] views not need propsÂ by react components

POSSIBLY:

- [ ] Paperclip
  - [ ] implement "is" with components
    - [ ] can do neat diagrams about grouped elements
    - [ ] ability to inherit styles (assuming it matches spec)

- [ ] show inferred types for component as they're being coded
#### FOCUS
