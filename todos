Notes about this doc:

- Checklist items are ordered by importance.
- Remove a checklist item when it's completed.

Focus:

- more on visual tools - writing CSS tools 
- look for top Css tools - implement those


----------------------------------
IMMEDIATE
----------------------------------

Start working on UX around getting started with Tandem and projects.

Messaging:

TODO - strip of all functionality that does not work all the time - need to
resolve UX. May want to optimize experience around writing code.

NEW TARGET: Dev tools - qa testing. Develop

- [ ] minimap

- [ ] BUGS
  - [ ] need to reconnect if network drops 
  - [ ] height seems to be inherited
    child class must contain parent class - e.g: .header .title, where .header contains the height prop 
  - [ ] elements with padding & margin jump around when dragging assuming that the element pos is absolute
  - [ ] artboards do not show up if there's an error in the load
  - [ ] canvas still misalaigned

- [ ] Collaborating

- [ ] DEV tools
  - [ ] *javascript console
  - [ ] HTML inspector

- right click - edit text

- [ ] bark for unsaved changes

- [ ] Editor
  - [ ] History
  - [ ] unsaved files pane

- [ ] Stability
  - [ ] analytics on usage
  - [ ] auto updater
  - [ ] account for infinite loops in code

- [ ] rotate artboard button
- [ ] scrolling artboards (alt key?) 

----------------------------------
NOTES
----------------------------------

- [ ] tandem must have full UI editing capabilities. Too much context switching between code & design

----------------------------------
LAUNCHING
----------------------------------

WEBSITE
  - [ ] cross-browser testing demo (show same browser window with different icons


----------------------------------
STABILITY
----------------------------------

DOCS
  - [ ] browser compatibility table (what you can & cannot currently do in Tandem)

UX
  - [ ] *"LIVE" button that loads the application up in an iframe in the client

  - [ ] launch tandem from vscode
  - [ ] VM developer console
  - [ ] gutters need to be resizable
  - [ ] input focus border
  - [ ] multi drag
  - [ ] minimap (can also be done by opening up a new window of tandem)
  - [ ] incompatible browser notification

TESTING
 - [ ] test various webpack configs
 - [ ] use various websites as fixtures

BUGS
  - [ ] prevent copy & paste html elements in css inspector
  - [ ] cannot resize artboard to 0/0 width/height
  - [ ] do not resolve full path for html ext - causing issues when copying & pasting - use relative path instead
  - [ ] css class selectors are case insensitive
  - [ ] disable attributes that are dynamically created (React for instance)
  - [ ] fix absolute bounds for elements
  - [ ] cannot rapidly change .tsx? documents
  - [ ] pseudo elements (::before) fooing with override flags
  - [ ] css changes don't immediately get reflected in text editor
  - [ ] rebundle when file name changes. App locks up when file not found

CLEANUP
  - [ ] do not use absolute paths for dependency graphs
  - [ ] custom protocol handling
  - [ ] Consider moving sandbox JS and html functionality into synthetic-browser

----------------------------------
