  - [ ] ensure that it works with Aurelia 
  - [ ] ensure that tools work under all cases

----------------------------------
NOTES
----------------------------------

- [ ] tandem must have full UI editing capabilities. Too much context switching between code & design

----------------------------------
STABILITY
----------------------------------

UX
  - [ ] *"LIVE" button that loads the application up in an iframe in the client

  - [ ] launch tandem from vscode
  - [ ] VM developer console
  - [ ] gutters need to be resizable
  - [ ] input focus border
  - [ ] minimap (can also be done by opening up a new window of tandem)
  - [ ] incompatible browser notification

TESTING

 - [ ] use various websites as fixtures

BUGS
  - [ ] prevent copy & paste html elements in css inspector
  - [ ] cannot resize artboard to 0/0 width/height
  - [ ] do not resolve full path for html ext - causing issues when copying & pasting - use relative path instead
  - [ ] css class selectors are case insensitive
  - [ ] disable attributes that are dynamically created (React for instance)
  - [ ] fix absolute bounds for elements
  - [ ] cannot rapidly change .tsx? documents
  - [ ] pseudo elements (::before) fooing with override flags
  - [ ] css changes don't immediately get reflected in text editor
  - [ ] rebundle when file name changes. App locks up when file not found

CLEANUP
  - [ ] do not use absolute paths for dependency graphs
  - [ ] custom protocol handling
  - [ ] Consider moving sandbox JS and html functionality into synthetic-browser
