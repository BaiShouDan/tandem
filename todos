IMMEDIAT
----------------------------------

Start working on UX around getting started with Tandem and projects.

Messaging:

No setup required.
This is only the beginning

TODO - strip of all functionality that does not work all the time - need to
resolve UX. May want to optimize experience around writing code.

Polish up vanilla HTML ext

- [ ] change to tandem-code
- [ ] right click + open any index.html file
- [ ] test on windows
- [ ] auto updater
- [ ] update banner
- [ ] right click context menus

- [ ] Core
  - [ ] ability to load HTTP urls
  - [ ] do NOT use file paths anymore - use urls
    - [ ] file watcher dependent on url type
  - [ ] *wait for all XHR requests to be completed before sending diff - (flickering otherwise)
  - [ ] enable history push state observations in app (test for todomvc example)
  - [ ] ensure that location changes are observable
  - [ ] ability to dynamically add dependencies to the dependency graph -- required for stuff like systemjs.

  - [ ] open main code editor with shift click if not already opened
  - [ ] open tandem from text editor
  - [ ] open any file with tandem
  - [ ] ability to setup workspace before saving one
  - [ ] Add file CTA when no artboards are present
  - [ ] remove layout for getting started, use abs pos
  
- [ ] BUGS
  - [ ] source maps not working for CSS 
  - [ ] source maps not working with React
  - [ ] elements with padding & margin jump around when dragging assuming that the element pos is absolute
  - [ ] app locked if artboard has a broken link
  - [ ] fix "channel close" linking back to source
  - [ ] cannot dynamically add <script /> tags since dependency graph doesn't load that stuff in 
  - [ ] child processes are STILL not shutting down  
  - [ ] need to unwatch sources that have been deleted. Try removing an artboard, then deleting the source linked to it.
  - [ ] artboards do not show up if there's an error in the load
  - [ ] Fix vscode source code overwrites
  - [ ] local images must work in HTML ext
  - [ ] fix zombie process

- [ ] Getting Started page
  - [ ] big header explaining how to zoom & use tools


- [ ] UX
  - [ ] open main code editor
  - [ ] getting started project
  - [ ] import existing HTML file from start page - auto-create artboards

- [ ] Stability
  - [ ] analytics on usage
  - [ ] auto updater
  - [ ] account for infinite loops in code

- [ ] top bar
  - [ ] share workspace
- [ ] comment tag? kind of like code comments, but visual - possibly td-comment attribute
- [ ] source maps not working for CSS

- [ ] scrolling artboards (alt key?) 
  - [ ] need usage report prompt
  - [ ] first startup config
  - [ ] extensions
  
----------------------------------
POLISH
----------------------------------

- [ ] must work with regular webpack config - just open HTML file

- [ ] do not dispatch ApplyFileEdit action for each input
  - [ ] store edits somewhere until explicitly saved

----------------------------------
LAUNCHING
----------------------------------

< BURN
  - [ ] default project should be an interactive tutorial

TESTING
  - [ ] Firefox support
  - [ ] safari support
  - [ ] TodoMVC examples
  - [ ] actually build apps
  - [ ] load random websites
  - [ ] code "playground" for features before they're released

PROMO
  - [ ] online demo with codemirror (like jsfiddle)
  - [ ] try online

WEBSITE
  - [ ] cross-browser testing demo (show same browser window with different icons

----------------------------------
STABILITY
----------------------------------

UX
  - [ ] display title of document (if present)
  - [ ] VM developer console
  - [ ] gutters need to be resizable
  - [ ] input focus border
  - [ ] multi drag
  - [ ] minimap (can also be done by opening up a new window of tandem)
  - [ ] incompatible browser notification

TESTING
 - [ ] use todomvc code for testing synthetic browser
 - [ ] test various webpack configs

BUGS
  - [ ] do not resolve full path for html ext - causing issues when copying & pasting - use relative path instead
  - [ ] css class selectors are case insensitive
  - [ ] disable attributes that are dynamically created (React for instance)
  - [ ] fix absolute bounds for elements
  - [ ] cannot change source of artboard
  - [ ] cannot rapidly change .tsx? documents
  - [ ] pseudo elements (::before) fooing with override flags
  - [ ] css changes don't immediately get reflected in text editor
  - [ ] rebundle when file name changes. App locks up when file not found
  - [ ] Kill remotely dispatched messages if there are no responses.

ARCHITECTURE
  - [ ] db oplog tailing
  - [ ] artboard should define window size

CLEANUP
  - [ ] do not use absolute paths for dependency graphs
  - [ ] custom protocol handling
  - [ ] Consider moving sandbox JS and html functionality into synthetic-browser

----------------------------------
