IMMEDIAT
----------------------------------

Start working on UX around getting started with Tandem and projects.

Messaging:

No setup required.
This is only the beginning

TODO - strip of all functionality that does not work all the time - need to
resolve UX. May want to optimize experience around writing code.

Polish up vanilla HTML ext
