LAUNCHING
----------------------------------

< BURN
  - [ ] default project should be an interactive tutorial

TESTING
  - [ ] Firefox support
  - [ ] safari support
  - [ ] TodoMVC examples
  - [ ] actually build apps
  - [ ] load random websites
  - [ ] code "playground" for features before they're released

PROMO
  - [ ] online demo with codemirror (like jsfiddle)
  - [ ] try online

WEBSITE
  - [ ] cross-browser testing demo (show same browser window with different icons

----------------------------------
STABILITY
----------------------------------

UX
  - [ ] VM developer console
  - [ ] gutters need to be resizable
  - [ ] custom layer for artboard
  - [ ] input focus border

BUGS
  - [ ] css class selectors are case insensitive

  - [ ] cannot rapidly change .tsx? documents
  - [ ] pseudo elements (::before) fooing with override flags
  - [ ] css changes don't immediately get reflected in text editor
