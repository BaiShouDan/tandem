## Mesh is a messsage routing library based on the [stream standard](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/).

**This is updated version of [Mesh.js](http://mesh.js.org/). This library will eventually be moved [here](https://github.com/crcn/mesh.js) after it becomes a bit more stable.**

#### Motivation

Mesh was created to normalize how an application sends & receives messages throughout the application, and to other connected services over protocols such as HTTP, TCP, websockets, and others. 


#### Kitchen sink example

```typescript
import { CallbackBus } from "mesh";


```
