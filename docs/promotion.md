Ideas for things that help people really wrap their head around saffron and how to build apps with it. Also providing
some level of security to mitigate any anxiety around the possible risks of adopting this new & hip thing.

#### Fears

1. One-man team - will this thing be around long term?
2. Long term support and backwards compatibility
3. Browsert compatibility?
4. Feels like it's too limiting - what if I run into an edge case that saffron doesn't support?
5. long-term support and backward compatibility
6. Merge conflicts & collaboration issues with other team members
7. Stack traces & debugging

#### Risk mitigation

1. Lots of examples - various sophisticated types that are otherwise difficult to do in real code.
2. Show what you can do in app that you cannot easily do in code.
3. Help early adopters, get tons of feedback from thought leaders. 
  - Design agencies, people, companies that are willing to try new tools.
4. Cannot be coupled to app implementation - must cover *every* UI case.
  - Must be interoperable with custom UI code
5. Backwards compatibility with older versions of saffron
6. file format should be human readable & editable.
