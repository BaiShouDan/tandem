#### Keep this in mind when writing code

- [ ] do not abstract CSS. Build tools that augment it.
- [ ] write tools that help organize designs. Also write tools that help refactor design that are monolithic (exporting layers to individual files for instance)

#### When writing features

- focus on features that might bog down the entire app, but are essential

#### Future

- [ ] online community where people can show their creations. Like codepen
