#### Events

Everything is initially triggered by an event. A user input, change, anything. The event is always the start of an output, which connects to an input. A few additional examples 
of this might include:

- timer firing events
- user input
- 

Events have a beginning and an end. This means that all events fire off a stream of information.

#### Streams

- i/o streams. Everything is a stream. Streams are asynchronous, and are initialized by an event. 

#### Inputs

- Inputs from an event to a given component.

#### Outputs

- Connections on events.
