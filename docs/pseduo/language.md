The core of saffron is a markup language based on HTML -- this is for a number of reasons:

1. Programmers comming from an HTML & CSS background will be able to pickup saffron
very easily.
2. HTML is already mature, and takes the inventiveness out of saffron
3. Re #1, saffron will require less documentation. 
4. People will be able to use saffron with their pre-existing application
